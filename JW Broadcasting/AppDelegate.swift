    This method breaks down JSON files converting them to NSDictionaries.
    
    Firstly grabs data from the path parameter.
    Second strips away all HTML entities (E.g. &amp; = &)
    Finally using NSJSONSerialization the data is converted into a usable NSDictionary class.


    WARNING
    
    This method is failable depending on what data is passed in.
