- Although it's functional, this app is still a work in progress. Lots of code clean up and comments remain to be done.



DEMO TIPS

VIDEO ON DEMAND
- Content is automatically organzied. First items displayed are Featured followed by other custom categorizations. 
- 'From Our Studio' uses custom code to remove 'JW Broadcastingâ€”" and add "Braodcast" to the end of the title name for easier reading. This is hardcoded and only works in English but other languages can easily be added.
- Not all images displayed are ideally sized, so an ordered list is used to select correct size, starting with images types of 'wss', 'lss', 'wsr', 'pss', and psn'


AUDIO
- Content is auto organized. 
- NOTE: Investigating new UI for the 'Audio' tab to take into account the unique UI needs of finding and playing music, e.g. large quantity of items, lots to swipe through, No 'Play All' or 'Shuffle' buttons, etc.


LANGUAGE
- Select from amoung 78 differnet supported language types, including English, Danish, ASL, Chinese and Arabic.
- Languages are displayed in the local vernacular so you can always tell what language is your language.
- NOTE: Code is in place to keep you on the page while new content in the selected language is loaded.
- Apple TV does not incldue a font for Myanmar, so JW Broadcast app included an open source font called Myanmar3.
- DEMO TIP: Try changing to other languages (e.g. Chinese, ASL, Russian, Arabic, etc.)
